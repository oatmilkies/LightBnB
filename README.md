# LightBnB

Welcome to LightBnB! This project is a simplified version of Airbnb, a platform for booking accommodations. This is a student project created using the template from [Lighthouse Labs' LightBnB_WebApp](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/LightBnB_WebApp).

The main objectives of this project were to learn to design, create, manipulate, and interact with databases. These actions are found in the LightBnB_WebApp/db/database.js file. The database used is PostgreSQL, and the server is built using Node.js and Express.js.
